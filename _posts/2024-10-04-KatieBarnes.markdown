Katie L. Barnes is a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she works in Dr. Laura Knoll’s lab, focusing on the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Her journey into research began at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she studied the insect-specific bacteria Wolbachia in parasitic nematodes under the mentorship of Dr. Bill Sullivan. Katie’s passion for science is driven by a desire to help others and create a supportive community. She attributes her current success to the encouragement and support she received from those around her.

With this mission in mind, and after gaining a deeper understanding of her own sexuality during graduate school, Katie became involved with the Pride in Microbiology Network. This organization allows her to combine her love for communication and community-building by connecting individuals across various spaces and experiences. She is eager to continue building up the Queer community.
